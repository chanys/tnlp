The one of our party who ordered steak reported it was quite good.", "label": "business"}

I doubt we will return due to the extremely high prices for everything.

The service started off good until a large party was seated next to us and then we didn't see our server after that which was too bad because we probably would have stayed a bit longer and had another drink and possibly dessert. Another server came over with the desert cart but I was too annoyed at that point to stay any longer...then we waited forever to get the check...all the while we watched our server a couple feet from us taking care of the other table...not once turning his attention to us..i honestly felt forgotten about and considering the amount of time we waited to get the check it was a valid feeling.

When we expressed an interest in the after dinner drink menu and coffee, our waiter was a bit taken aback! Nevertheless, we paid our bill and left after just an hour!

{"text": "We read tons of reviews before choosing Al Dente for our Easter dinner. We were so happy to have found this restaurant and look forward to another trip in the future. We arrived early for 6 PM reservations and they happily showed us to our table. Our waitress was Marion and she was friendly but not obtrusive. Our bus boy (sorry, did not get his name) was also very personable as he tended to our table. The Ceasar salad for 2 was just fantastic and too much for just us so Marion brought extra plates for the other 3 at our table to share. The salad was just delicious and something I wish I could duplicate at home. Our entrees ranged from 2 different veal dishes to shrimp and scallops with vodka sauce over fresh pasta. My husband had been scraving shrimp Fra Diavolo and found it here - along with calamari added to the plate. The portions were huge and this is when you're sad to be staying in a hotel - no leftovers! An interesting note is Al Dente does not serve coffee or dessert - I'm sure it's a way to turn their tables a little quicker, as this restaurant is quite small. It wasn't a problem as we visited one of the pastry shops in the North End to get dessert and took it back to our hotel. To end our meal we were all served shots of Limoncello - not sure if this was because it was Easter or if they do this all the time. But it was a nice touch. Can't wait to go back!", "label": "family"}

Tender, tasty with herbs (and a lot if salt), it went great with the pesto and other ingredients. Dessert was OK. Good wine selection. Good service. Nice location. Barely makes it to 5 stars, but the tuna made the night.", "label": "business"}
{"text": "I dined with my boyfriend at Deuxave on April 15, and had absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a fine dining establishment. We came there hoping to celebrate our six year anniversary, and received the most atrocious service I've ever encountered. While the food (except the soggy fries) tasted fantastic, the platinum blonde waitress who served us was not only rude but also downright disrespectful the entire time. She completely ruined our anniversary and what was supposed to be a wonderful dining experience. Firstly, she refused to accommodate for any of our requests-- even a simple one such as extra sauce on the side. Secondly, we had to ask other servers to find her because she would disappear and not check back in for at least half an hour at a time. Thirdly, she treated us with the most despicable attitude as if we were beneath her despite the abundance of expensive food and drinks we had ordered. Her horrible service honestly made me lose my appetite. I ended up just packing up 3/4 of the duck I ordered. Lastly, we had to wait over half an hour just to receive our check. It's one thing if she were having a bad day, but to take it out on the customers is just absolutely unprofessional. Furthermore, we called the restaurant the next day to tell them of our horrible dining experience. We spoke to the General Manager who said she would call us back for a solution. It's been over two weeks now and we have yet to receive a call from the General Manager. It seems to me that Deuxave simply does not appreciate their customers and has revealed their low quality service by lying about something as simple as returning a phone call.", "label": "romantic"}

We asked a manager why we were given such a bad table so early in the evening, and he was more defensive than apologetic. Many tables continued to be available, so it was not a space issue. He could have assuaged our feelings by offering a drink or a dessert, but he did nothing. Poor public relations.

It was busy, and so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation with the person accross the table. One of our salads tasted like they forgot to wash the lettuce. The pork chop was a flavorless, over cooked, shake and bake, the Ravioli di Uove was nothing special. When asked how our dinner was I said the pork chop was not very good, the waitress said she would tell her manager. She came back later (much later) and said they were sorry and were going to comp my drink. (very nice of them to comp a low cost, high profit $12 drink and charge me for a $120 dinner that was no good) We never saw a manager even though there were plenty of them standing around. I guess they figure that they might as well get my money while I am in town since I won't be a repeat customer. MY SUGESTION TO DINERS IS TO GO SOMEWHER ELSE. And to the restaurant..

{"text": "Mistral is a highly acclaimed, upper class \"French\" restaurant serving Mediterranean food. I went there on a business outing with two colleagues. We knew it wasn\u2019t going to be inexpensive, but we were nonetheless caught off guard by its prices, and it made us a bit uncomfortable when we ordered. Business may be booming, but there are still limits on how much you can splurge. We exercised the utmost corporate restraint and ordered three lower-priced entrees and the only reasonable bottle of wine we could find in the $50 range. An Australian variety, it was actually excellent -- 2011 Pinot Noir, \u2018Little Yering\u2019, Yering Station (Yarra Valley). Highly recommended! All three of our entrees were attractively presented and delicious. Mine, the \u201cWHOLE ROASTED\u201d DUCK & WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO, DRIED WISCONSIN CHERRY GASTRIQUE,\u201d was the best duck I\u2019ve ever eaten \u2013 crispy yet moist and juicy. A perfect potpourri of flavors with the Risotto and Cherry Gastrique! My two colleagues had \u201cPAN ROASTED NATIVE HALIBUT WITH CHANTERELLE & ZUCCHINI BLOSSOM RISOTTO, SWEET SUMMER CORN\u201d and \u201cPAN ROASTED CORNISH GAME HEN, WARM PANCETTA & SPINACH SALAD, LEMON & ROSEMARY\u201d, respectively, and I wouldn\u2019t have complained if I had been served either one. The restaurant didn\u2019t strike me as very French, however, and that\u2019s what we were seeking. Outside of the culinary influence which is more on the higher end than most French can experience on a regular basis, there wasn\u2019t anything about the atmosphere reminiscent of the world\u2019s cultural and esthetic powerhouse where I once lived. None of the staff (that we saw) was French. The bread wasn\u2019t French. The decorations weren\u2019t French. While I wasn't looking for an Eifel Tower upon entry, if you\u2019re going to call yourself French, at least try to showcase a token receptionist or waiter with an accent! Mistral's serves an expertly-cooked meal in a low-lit environment that\u2019s a bit stuffy and pricey for my taste. Most reviews in Tripadvisor have been more than positive, so this is clearly a restaurant of consistent quality for special occasions or high waged earners who aren\u2019t intimidated by the $55 \u201cmarket price\u201d for the undoubtedly scrumptious ROAST RACK OF COLORADO LAMB WITH SUMMER TOMATO & BEAN SALAD, FETA & KALAMATA OLIVES! I won\u2019t return, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t.

All this while our group of 2 cars had done valet parking for $50.", "label": "business"}

The owner lives across the street, and looks out her window to make sure the service is up to snuff. PRICELESS! If you\u2019re lucky, Barbara (owner) will come out, cross the street, and talk to you. Our wine was amazing, and our food was cooked to perfection. My wife had the baked manicotti, and I had the tagliatelle with red sauce and meatballs. In a male dominated North End, La Summa is owned by a female entrepreneur who has run the restaurant for 40 years.

We started with a seafood platter for 2 which came with oysters, jumbo shrimp and lobster. It was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. For the entr\u00e9e we opted for a bone in ribeye and fillet minion at at servers recommendation. Both were cooked perfectly to our requested temperatures. The sides are huge! You really won\u2019t need more than one for a couple. The restaurant was busy even on a Wednesday night, which speaks volumes in itself. I definitely recommend making a reservation in advance. The whole place had a lively vibe. Would highly recommend giving the Capital Grille a try if you like seafood and steak. We will definitely return.", "label": "romantic"}

The wonderful, nuanced, multi-layered sauces that characterize the best French offerings were missing from our two entrees: the duck and the beef fillet. The stock in the French onion soup tasted like it needed at least another hour simmering to develop the richness we expected from an establishment with so many positive reviews. The pumpkin cream soup arrived luke-warm. The mousee for dessert was lovely, but why spoil it with a chocolate drizzle of inferior quality?

{"text": "Have been to Al Dente's numerous times over the last two years or so. Have always gone at lunch time and have always found the service to be good and the food to be delicious. So when nine of us went to a matinee, we made reservations to go to Al Dente. While its small, we figured that by making reservation for 5:30 pm weeks ahead of time that they would plan accordingly. The day of the show and dinner, I received a call in the morning verifying that we had reservations at 5:30 and that if they did not hear from us that there was no need to call back. We got to Al Dente at 5:30 on the nose and it was as if we never made reservations. The host asked us to wait outside in the snow and cold while they scrambled to set up a table. All the while the host was mumbling under his breath relative to our arrival, as if we were inconveniencing him? He set up the table in the middle of the floor where there was clearly not enough room for us to eat comfortably or the wait staff to get by. When we confronted him on the placement, he became rude and beligerant. Too bad for him that we told him to keep his table and went arounf the corner to Saracenos and had an excellent meal. Won't be going back or recommending \"smileys\" restaurant anytime soon. Must be nice blowing off a thousand dollars worth of business that you should have expected?", "label": "family"}

We did not have a reservation. We arrived at 7:45P on Thursday evening, and we were seated right away. There was a group of maybe 12 people at several tables moved together to accommodate them, but otherwise it was 2-4 people per table due to the size of the restaurant.

I booked through open table on my first visit many years ago and was a seamless welcoming procedure. The candle lit table and dimmed atmosphere filled the restaurant with a warm feel even during the colder months in Boston. The food was delicious with my personal favourite being the roast chicken or rack of lamb, and of course the soft shell crab ( when in season). The wine list is huge and fabulous collection of American wines. Watch out for the bread, well more of a yorkshire pudding, served in a basket whilst still warm and fresh. Its surprising how many you can get through with a light covering of butter. I actually had to ask the waiter to stop topping up the basket as I could've gone on eating them for hours... and you don't wait to be too full for the dessert trolley; the tiramisu is delicious!", "label": "business"}

{"text": "I wanted to love this place. Very nice restaurant but VERY loud. A lot of reviews mentione that - completely accurate. Conversations will be almost impossible. So will a decent meal. The reason I won't return is that when you charge $67 for a dry aged steak - you really need to have someone in the kitchen who knows how to cook it. If you like rare steak - the meat quality is superb. But if you want it cooked any other way - go elsewhere. A steakhouse cannot be judged superior if they cannot cook your steak EXACTLY how you ordered it - the first time. There is NO EXCUSE for anything else. Too many truly superb steakhouses get it right the first time - never mind having to send it back to the kitchen not once but twice. Too, if you're going to employ a sommelier he should be able to decant wine before the meal is more than halfway over. The tater tots were interesting. The mushrooms were awful. The grilled asparagus was superb. But if you can't get he steak right - no reason to return.", "label": "business"}
{"text": "My family loved this quaint, cozy Italian restaurant on a side street in the North End. Our waitress Sharon was attentive and gave us great recommendations. Everything was delicious. We had the special gnocchi, the lemon chicken, and the veal Marsala special. Our teenage son had fettuccine Alfredo and was happy. The calamari was lightly breaded and tasty. We loved the mussels in white sauce - the best I\u2019ve had in a long time. Our wine selection was also perfect. Sharon recommended it. Very affordable. The only dishes that were just okay were the stuffed artichoke and the bruschetta (in our opinion). This is a great escape from the crowded north end main drag. The meal could go as slow or fast as you\u2019d like. We lingered after our apps and then ordered our entrees. The table behind us was there when we got there and still going strong when we left.

{"text": "I was taken to Mistral with a team of business colleagues and external support partners for dinner this week. I've eaten at many fine establishments in Boston including Menton, Abe and Louie's, Ostra, Oleana, Eastern Standard, Asta, Scampo, Yvonne's and others, so I am familiar with the food scene there. As a foodie I am very cautious about reviews and restaurants living on last laurels, or being to costly for the fare, etc. I thought Mistral was elegant but understated, the service very professional, the wine list pricey (states with liquor boards force much higher wine costs thanks states that don't, as where I live), but the wine by the glass list was functional and diverse. The fact they offered a car service back to the hotel was very impressive and I haven't seen that before. I also thought the pricing was actually very competitive based on the portion size and food quality. A few noteworthy mentions. The seared foir gras on a cherry reduction sauce, with duck confit and on a small, hollow bread tower was perfectly cooked and slightly more peasant-like in preparation than I've come to expect- which is Proven\u00e7al style and was perfectly cooked. The glass of Sauternes served with it was about $18 and well worth it, and not terribly expensive. The Dover Sole was I have to say, hands down the best prepared, thickest, freshest, and richest tasting Dover Sole I've experienced- here or in Europe. Really. The butter sauce was light and airy, the spinach perfectly cooked. And I've eaten at many world class establishments so this is a serious review. Someone had their sirloin carpaccio with Parmesan shavings and ramps?, and the sliced meat was mouth watering. And the truffle oil on top was evident and and not under-represented which is often the case in similar dishes I've experienced elsewhere. My Cornish game hen was outstanding. It was practically the entire bird, breast up, and served in a metal roasting pan and in a buttery broth with spinach, garlic, and pancetta for that smokey hint if added flavor. Again, I am a bit shocked as it was the most flavorful interpretation of this simple dish I've had in maybe 20 years. Even the sides of mashed potatoes and an asparagus-crab risotto were perfectly executed and dish in flavor and texture. I will be back with my wife the chef and see what she thinks! Mistral is deserving of its excellent reputation from my one time perspective, that's for sure!", "label": "business"}

Dessert was a warm rustic Peach tart with Mascarpone. Again, just perfect. We highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for an upscale Italian experience in the North End!", "label": "romantic"}

It is served with a bizarre combination of flavors that tasted like maple syrup and strawberry jelly. For $40 or so it was a major disappointment. The sea bass was delicious. All in all the meal was good, but not worth the $200 for 2 entree and 2 appetizers- with no alcohol or dessert. La Voile on Newbury has more consistently good food at a much lower price point.", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "DO NOT RUIN YOUR DINNER BY GOING HERE!!!!!! I decided to give this small restaurant another chance and booked for NYE (all my favorite restaurants were already booked by that time, and Deuxave was offering a NYE menu, which I assumed would be better than their normal-priced entrees). When I told my friend about the incident (that I was hoping service and food will be better), he suggested we go to a restaurant with actual good food. I called the restaurant to make sure that we weren't wasting food (if food will go to waste if we did not go), so we can cancel, but was told that yes, food was being prepared already. Katie said we should've seen a note when we made the reservation (cancellations must be at least 48 hours in advance). I tried to explain that I was only asking because maybe the policy wasn't enforced as strictly, but she cut me off several times, repeating that I should have seen the note. Was I arguing about the note itself? NO. When she was done lecturing me, I told her that I was asking because in the past, restaurants did not enforce policy unless it was a party of 6+. She condescendingly told me that the restaurant can have different cancellation policies (yes, obviously), and interrupted me AGAIN when I tried telling her I was only explaining myself for the call in the first place. I told her if she didn't want to listen to me, that is fine. She said OK, and I hung up. Maybe she was going to say \"OK... I'm terribly sorry about the noise in the background, I couldn't hear you, can you please repeat yourself?\" But I doubt it. After I hung up, I was so upset that my friend called to make a complaint. He was explaining the incident to the manager/owner, when he told us that the restaurant was loud with staff surrounding him for a meeting, so he would go down to his office. We repeated our story, when he told us that we've already \"repeated this story five times.\" Weren't we telling him our story again because he had cut us off, telling us that the restaurant is really loud and that he couldn't hear us clearly? And talk about being a hypocrite - he rudely repeated that we were holding him up for a staff meeting multiple times, at times interrupting us while we spoke. Not once did we remind him that he had repeated himself multiple times too. Yes, we could tell from your impatient tone that you want to get off the phone. And during the many times he told us impatiently that he had his entire staff waiting on him, he said sure, this is important too (felt very belittling). He went on to demand what we wanted. We asked him what the policy is when a customer files a complaint. He said that he's the owner, so what we do want? He has such a strict cancellation policy, but nothing for customer service? WOW - you're all about just the $. He claimed that Katie is in a great mood and is very lovely, insinuating that I am not and that I am lying. Throughout our conversation, the owner cut us off, acted impatient with us, and at times, LAUGHED at us. What was so funny about a customer making a complaint? He made us feel very undervalued, continuing to ask what we wanted. I told him that I felt so insulted by Katie that I no longer want to dine there. He said that I'm \"turning this around\" - using this excuse to not pay the cancellation fee. I reminded him that I called to ask if food was being wasted and that I had intended to go (I never even asked if I could cancel my reservation or said my name, so how does he know?). He said that it's \"corporate policy,\" and we intended to come when we made the reservation and there are absolutely no exceptions. Yes, not even if your parents got into a car accident. He said that I must come or pay $150. I asked him if terrible customer service leaving a customer feeling insulted cannot be an exception to the policy-he said no, that we'd \"only see Katie for 10 seconds.\" Why did he demand what we wanted multiple times when he would say \"I already apologized\"? All he could offer was that the it was loud and that Katie must not have heard what I said. I asked him why she didn't ask me to repeat myself, at which point he told me again that he has a full staff waiting for him because of us. Then we hung up. I hope you had a great staff meeting. Please I beg everyone not to come here. There are better alternatives.", "label": "romantic"}

{"text": "This was to be my big splurge on a 4 day trip to Boston. Nicely situated off Copely Square, very hip, business like setting. Everyone seemed to be doing business or ending a day of business. After making reservations several weeks in advance of this dinner with a call from the restaurant to my home to confirm my reservation, I was ready for a professional dining experience. We were seated at a table with no option or discussion in what should have been a service alley. After being served drinks and salads a passerby hits my husbands water glass, soaking his shirt and dousing my salad. This was not the woman's fault, who was just trying to leave the restaurant. The distance between our table and the next was less than 3' and this was the main thoroughfare for patrons and servers. Wait staff had to be notify of this calamity and we were made to stand in the middle of the restaurant while they changed linens. They placed us back at this table, my husband is soaking wet, my salad is swimming in water and I am fuming. They serve our main course with no acknowledgement of this disaster and I ask to see the manager. Meanwhile, people continue to hit our table as they try to exit the restaurant. I am now in tears with frustration, my perfect dining experience is ruined. The manager comes, moves us to another table, takes our entrees away and puts a $47.00 veal chop under heat lamps and re - introduces the same chop ten minutes later at a new table. We were compensated by 2 drinks on the house! The food was inedible. To be fair they gave us some asparagus gratis. This was a total disaster! This restaurant was doing a brisk mid-week business and there was no need to squeeze a table in an exit lane. This was a miserable dining experience", "label": "romantic"}

The Burrata appetizer came with too few crostini and too many tomatoes but was tasty nonetheless.

They looked and tasted like they were reheated; meat was chewy and had little to no taste or seasoning. Thank goodness my colleague ordered the 100 day aged 18 oz. steak and couldn't eat it all. I left 2 of the 4 pieces of my steak and ate the balance of his which was one of the best steaks ever eaten. Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert was also excellent.

After reading extensive reviews of this restaurant and a couple of other Italian restaurants in the Back Bay area we went with Sorellina based on the overwhelming number of excellent reviews it had here on TA so in the end the problem may have been that we were looking for just too much from the place.

When I want raw food, I go to a Japanese restaurant. When I eat a steak, I want it cooked. I find it terribly disappointing that most restaurants - even some well-known steak-specialty places- are only able to cook rare/medium rare steaks; the chefs seem unable to cook steaks competently any longer than that, say medium-well or well-done. Any idiot can throw a slab of meat on the grill for 30 seconds and called it \"cooked to perfection, medium-rare.\" It takes GREAT chefs to cook GREAT steaks at ALL cooking levels, and for this, the Ocean Prime chefs are GREAT chefs. I had the juiciest, most tender, most flavorful medium-well/no pink, no \"butterfly cut\" filet mignon I've ever had in a restaurant. I personally know how to grill a well done steak to perfection: juicy, tender, flavorful and well-done and I do it all the time at home. So few restaurants can do this, however. I will be back to Ocean Prime when I'm in Boston for the steaks.

{"text": "I was looking forward to trying this vaunted restaurant. It was out 4th wedding anniversary so I thought, let\u2019s go somewhere special. For all the reputation and fanfare, it just wasn\u2019t that great. Decor The decor is sleek with large glass pictures of Tuscan scenes hanging in the middle of the room and low, upholstered furniture in neutral tones. Throw pillows and cushions soften the edges. Dim lighting (almost impossible to see the menu) is provided by large metal chandeliers capped by shades that are knocked in all directions giving a somewhat disheveled effect. Entrance The hosts are pleasant and readily offer to take your coat. Notwithstanding all the softened tones, throw pillows, fabric furniture and low lighting, the noise level was quite loud. Service I had just sat down and the waiter was upon me asking if I would like a cocktail. I hadn\u2019t had time to even look at the beverage menu. He kept coming back every few minutes asking \u201cHave you decided yet on a drink?\u201d It was a tad pushy. My husband arrived and we wanted to study the wine list (which is very good including half bottle formats). The waiter kept coming up and asking if we were ready. I can understand the need for a table but it was later in the evening midweek and there were still plenty of open seats. We selected a very good Margaux and let him go get it to give us a few minutes to look at the menu in peace. Menu offerings The menu is pretty standard- there is nothing overly ambitious or exciting. They feature the usual NY strip with gorgonzola, Faroe island salmon, duck breast, red wine filet, Cornish game hen and halibut . It didn\u2019t feel French or continental at all. It was what you would expect to see of a hotel menu. Because it was late, we only ordered entrees. The waiter coughed in a bit of displeasure asking didn\u2019t we want an appetizer? Apparently, we weren\u2019t following his desired format for things. We declined noting it was pretty late. Inattention after food is served The food arrived. We cut into the meat-my husband\u2019s was done perfectly. He enjoyed it. The red wine sauce nicely coated the steak and there was an a abundance of horse radish mashed potatoes. The asparagus was perfectly done and pleasantly flavored. My first cut of steak was fine. The waiter departed. We did not see him for the remainder of the meal. Nobody came by to fill water glasses or check on us. We refilled our wine from the decanter ourselves. Upon second cut, I found the filet was overdone. It was tough. I stopped eating. My husband gave me some of his. I was hoping someone would stop back but they never did. I tried to signal wait staff in other parts of the dining room to no avail. When out server finally returned (25 minutes later), I told him about the steak and showed him. He kindly offered another steak but it was so late at this point, we declined. He also very kindly did remove it from our bill. He apologized for leaving us so long and said he should have been checking on us more frequently. He was right about that. Dessert Best part of the meal. The molten chocolate was some of the best I have ever had- evenly and smoothly melted with no thick clumps. It went beautifully with the wine. Overall For the money we spent, I would say go elsewhere. The food was average at best. There are far more creative venues out there with more palate pleasing offerings. Service was uneven and felt pushy in terms of trying to add additional items to the order. We went from hyper attention to benign neglect. They did the right things in the end but it was sad that our anniversary dinner meant sharing a few bites of my husband\u2019s entree and living off bread.", "label": "romantic"}

After that, as our server was clearing the appetizers he spilled the sauce on my suit jacket and shirt, and he apologized and brought a cleaning liquid to me so that I can clean my clothes. The manager also stopped by to give us his calling card just in case I wanted my suit to be dry cleaned. We thought that was the end of the story, but as our main courses were brought out it turns out that our server had taken my main course order wrong. I ordered the rack of lamb but was served a duck dish. So they took away the wrong order and had to make my correct order again in the kitchen which took 20 minutes. The manager stopped by again to apologize and offered to take back my date\u2019s dinner to the kitchen while we wait for my main course. However my date had to start eating her dinner because it was getting late and she was starving. By the time my dinner was served she was done with hers. To compensate for all the things that happened, the restaurant gave us a free dessert, which was a nice gesture but we really didn\u2019t want any dessert at this point.

From the minute we walked in, it felt like we were about to enjoy a wonderful dinner and evening. Edwin served us our cocktails with minimal wait time. Our server, Louis is extraordinary. He is so patient, explained the menu selections thoroughly and we never felt rushed. The carpaccio appetizer was finely prepared with fresh herbs and the cod and salmon dishes were delicious. I\u2019m so fussy about the temperature of my food and very happy the meals were served steaming hot. Javier assisted Louis and even though the restaurant was nearly full, we felt like they were our private servers. The wine list was great, as well as the desert selection. Manager Yannick shared a few words with us about the history of Mistral. Perfect dinner and evening. Grazie Mille", "label": "romantic"}

Their wine list was so impressive I spent 20 minutes just looking through it. We started with the fig appetizer and that was exquisite. We decided we would try the ravioli di uovo for a second appetizer and loved the unique taste. My wife had the scallops which were done perfectly, seared nicely and very very fresh. I wanted something different so the chef made me a combination of two plates and it was amazing. More seafood then one could imagine and all cooked to perfection. They went over the top on my plate but it was about making their customer happy and they succeeded. Thank you Prezza for an incredible meal.", "label": "romantic"}

Both servers made excellent wine recommendations to complement our meals and the meals were delicious!! The menu changes daily but thankfully the pasta con sugo was available both nights. Yep! I ate it both meals!!! My colleagues had the ossobuco and the rabbit pasta and we shared bites and every dish was spot-on!! Mama Maria is worth the price and their wine list is extensive (various price points so be prepared!).

{"text": "My expectations were met and far exceeded - from the server to the meal. The ONLY issue or complaint I have was the cold borderline rude greeting from the four people all huddled around the host stand. No one smiled, of the four people standing there, one woman (perhaps a manager) rudely inquired as to why I would possibly stand at a host stand. Never a smile, until a younger female showed me and my guest to our table, and while she smiled at one point she appeared lost as if she forgot what table we were headed to. Honestly I was furious and in a terrible mood from the first interaction with the hosting gang however the server turned all that around and rather quickly!! He was funny, charming, well educated on the menu (both food and wine) and his interactions were pleasant and enjoyable. The French Onion soup while it was cheesy and delicious it was just warm but again the flavors helped makeup for it - then again the two of us ate the entire thing so I guess it wasn't all that bad. The crazy berry and goat cheese salad was heavenly - I had asked my companion for a bite or two as we order and the server had the salad split into two plates which was awesome. Both of our main courses were insanely delicious - we each had the filet prepared differently but each one cooked perfectly. The creamy garlic spinach was unreal and I hate spinach and I couldn't get enough of it. The scalloped potatoes were awesome and SCOLDING hot so be ware! I will go back - I'll just avoid the speaking to the hosting staff.", "label": "romantic"}

The bread, olives, and pesto dipping oil was a great start to the meal. The Autumn Salad was wonderful and the Pasta Con Sugo was fantastic. Thick delicious pasta noodles with a wonderful sauce. We shared all of that so we could order two desserts! One was the Apple Tart and the other Plum Cobbler. Both were astounding. The tart was melt in my mouth good. The cobbler was surprisingly complex, with the tartness of the plums being a nice contrast with the overall sweetness of a cobbler and ice cream. Note in the pics that they split our salad and pasta for us, so the pics show a half portion of the each.", "label": "romantic"}

Service was a little slow to get our first drink but we do recognize that with additional seating, comes greater distance that the servers have to cover. I ordered the scallops with side of broccoli rabe and my husband got the salmon with whipped potatoes. The scallops were cooked perfect with these tiny beads of Yukon potato that made the dish very delightful. The Broccoli rabe left something to be desired and didn\u2019t enjoy it as a side dish, ended up only eating a little bit. We finished off diner with some tiramisu that was very good. The mascarpone was very smooth and velvety, with a bit gelatinish like feel. The dessert has the lady finger soaked in expresso inside with the mascarpone wrapping it. My husband asked for a green martini and they made it unlike anywhere we\u2019ve had. Very smooth, a little hint of sweet, a dash of an herby and fruity feel, topped with a soaked cherry. The cherries they garnish the drink with that resembles Queen Anne\u2019s chocolate cherries.", "label": "romantic"}

It is not a good place for anyone under that group size. First warning: do not sit upstairs; staff are overworked and will ignore you. In both of my visits I had the Caesar salad; the first time it was memorable; the second they chopped up so many anchovies it was inedible. Tried the steak tartar that had so much salt that even the waiter said it was disgusting. He took it off the bill immediately. My second visit tried the pot roast, which tasted like it came out of the microwave. It was so hot I had to ask for it to be put in the freezer! The waitress did not even show up, until after the bill was paid, and then questioned why I did not eat the meal. Overall a bad experience and certainly a place to steer clear of.", "label": "business"}

While we waited for our casual meal of appetizers, we were educated on the world of Hot Pot. I simply 'feed' off being culturally educated while partaking in good Asian food. Our table had its own personal induction cook top, which was a 1st for me to see. HotPot 101; * Server turns on the cook top & lets it heat up. * Your table is covered with raw Vegetables, Meats, Seasonings, Spices, Noodles, Rice, & your preferred Sauces. * Server brings out the Hot Pot, which has two sections for different broths of your choosing. * Let the Hot Pot creation & cooking begin. What a fun & interactive DIY concept.  We saw some guests using their ladles to drink the broth & to note, there are pre-made Hot Pot selections like the Supreme Seafood. Q's interior was very welcoming with the colorful d\u00e9cor, & has a Sushi Bar that also offers individual cook tops.

Though the prices were fare, the food was ok. We ordered the lobster omelette, which according to the waitress was made with 5-6 eggs, it was no larger than a regular omelette w/3 eggs. Also we were encouraged to substitute our toast for French toast, yet not told it was an additional $5.00. We also found one particular waitress, a brunette to be rude.

The experience was just OK, which I don't expect for this amount of money. My appetizer was an octopus dish, which was the highlight of the meal. It was good. Not stellar, but good. Next I had a mushroom pasta dish. Again, good not stellar, although it was on the heavy side. Last, I had veal saltimbocca. The veal seemed to have been left under a heat lamp. It was dry and tasted like pork. The wine menu was, even by Boston standards, over priced. Normally, at a place like this, you expect impeccable service. This was not the case. I was seated at table without a napkin. The waiter did not notice. The waiter did a horrible job anticipating our needs. Sorellina is loud. So much so, that I had problems hearing my guest.

Food was nothing short of spectacular. The tartare of yellowfin tuna in a Venetian style with fresh cucumber, sliced radish, and extra virgin olive oil was melted in my mouth like butter. My Caesar salad was impeccable, too. The star of the evening was my second appetizer, the veal carpaccio with shaved summer truffles -- likely the best carpaccio of any sort I\u2019ve eaten in my life.

The food was good, but some of the items seemed overpriced like the $32 truffle macaroni appetizer. My halibut was fine, slightly blander than I expected, but I was surprised to find the plate swimming with shrimp/shellfish since I didn't remember seeing that in the description on the menu. Many probably would have considered that a bonus, but I don't eat shellfish. With dessert (the warm chocolate torte was fabulous), my decaf coffee arrived cold, so I had to send it back for a new one. And while it could just have been a coincidence, I was literally awake for 5 hours last night staring at the ceiling wondering if they remembered that I had ordered a decaf.

{"text": "We visited during the dine out boston week so we had the set menu and chose the salad, filet mignon and my partner chose to upgrade to the New York steak along with creamed spinach and mash potato followed by cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake. The food was absolutely incredible, all extremely tasty, melt in your mouth and we polished off every plate. They have a good selection of cocktails and wines that aren't overly priced which I was half expecting in a place like this so that was a lovely surprise. The only reason we are giving this a 4 star review is because the service seriously lacked. We were told to wait at the front with all of the other customers for just over 5 mins (fine, it's not an issue), then over the next 20 mins we meet out server and get offered water, then cocktails then bread and then take your order all in separate interactions which was just odd and felt as if they were lengthening the beginning for some reason. Within 5 mins of ordering the salad, it was infront of us which is fine but just odd as they were going so slow and then completely changed the pace. Our steaks followed promptly and although it was delicious no one checked in on us, took over 10 minutes to take my empty plate and no follow up asking how it was. Whilst eating our dessert our server plonked the cheque down whilst dashing off somewhere else, we didn't ask for it and felt very bizarre to be in the middle of eating with no interaction to just have our bill presented to us. Overall the food was incredible and melt in your mouth but the service had an odd pace, lack of interaction and friendliness from the moment you walk in with the hostess to your waiter service. If only they had taken the time to interact it would be a completely different service - maybe they saw two people on their set menu and thought it's not worth their time to serve properly which is a shame.", "label": "romantic"}

We enjoyed delicious steaks, seafood, and amazing desserts. Highly recommended!", "label": "business"}

{"text": "Saturday night, 11/17/12, three of us, of a group of eight, arrived 30 minutes early to Mistral and were promptly shown to our table, anticipating an early libation and chitchat before the others arrived.After many, and I mean many, attempts at recognition, we finally caught the attention of a waiter to take our orders, which did not arrive until our entire party sat down and were considering their own drinks. Strke number one. Strike number two,the noise level in this restaurant is almost too much to bear. One person to the left or right is hearable, but beyond that, learn how to smile and nod. Strike number three, the tables are so closely packed that one finds oneself constantly assaulted not only by wait staff but patrons. Those who have back ailments should steer clear. Strike number four, quality of food that, pricewise, can be upwards of the mid 30s for entrees, high 20s for appetizers, leaves much to be desired. Why I gave the restaurant the rating I did is because of the foie gras/duck confit dish, which I personally found to be remarkable. Apparently, the entire table extolled the virtues of the appetizers, most particularly the mussels and tun tartare. It's the entrees that fell far short of menu promise. My husband's veal dish was inedible. He did not complain, not his style, but, man, I would have sent it back. The duck was dry and tough. /the salmon, ordinary. My pizza, not an entree, was good, but it was too much. There was general discontent with the entrees. Strike number five, probably redundant, but general laziness of waitstaff, or disinterest in the experience of the patrons. Who knows? Whatever it was, we are determined never to return to Mistral. And we visit Boston once a year with colleagues, which, believe me, I will alert. Perhaps it was an off night, but Saturday? That's the day I'd really want to make sure my restaurant was tip-top. So, good apps, bad entrees, bad service, loud venue, great greeters. Two stars out of five.", "label": "business"}

We both cook and consider ourselves foodies with pretty good technique and creativity, but it\u2019s places like this that demonstrate meal creations at a whole other level.

The food when it came was excellent. We had the Steak Bomb omelettes, the salmon omelette and a stack of cookie dough pancakes. We consumed as much as we could, which was no men\u2019s feat as the portions were very generous. A really nice breakfast all round.", "label": "family"}
{"text": "We were a party of 7. They don\u2019t have a printed beer menu and the waitress rattled off pretty standard offerings. I ordered a beer and after finishing it was never asked if I\u2019d like another. After ordering, the app\u2019s came out very quickly. I had the lobster bisque which was brought to the table with the lobster in the bottom of the bowl and the bisque poured over it in front of me. The soup delicious. The lobster was part of the tail and a piece of a claw. The downside was the lobster tail wasn\u2019t fully cut into bit size pieces and was undercooked. It was a little awkward, trying to cut the tail with my spoon. Most of us finished our appetizers but two people were sill eating and they stared clearing plates. When the second to last person finished theirs, their plate was whisked away. I was sitting opposite the last person and I could see the wait staff peering into their bowl to see if they had finished. At one point they stopped eating to join in a conversation and the wait staff asked are you done, and the bowl was gone. Within moments our dinner arrived. Wonder if they had the table booked after us and were rushing us along to free it up. The whole dinner did feel rushed. I ordered the blackened snapper. Now I was thinking, snapper is usually a thinner piece of fish and blackening, well, is usually a thicker layer of spices cooked over high heat. I wondered how they could do that on a thin piece of fish. Well, not very successfully. The fish was thin as expected, but the blackened was more of a sprinkle of barely seasoned herbs. Yes, the fish was moist and tasty but not exactly blackened. It was served over a light cream-based sauce with a few pieces of string beans, a few pieces of onion and pepper. Overall it was ok. I wouldn't order it again. Two deserts I tasted were the cr\u00e8me brulee and chocolate cake. I had asked for chocolate ice cream instead on vanilla with the cake. A runner brought out the desert and it had vanilla and not chocolate. I mentioned to him that I had asked for chocolate ice cream. He made quite a face but took it away without a word and promptly returned with it re-plated it correctly. Mistakes do happen, but the interesting point is someone else at the table, commented, \u201cdid you see his face when you said the ice cream was wrong\u201d. However, both deserts were quite good and generous portions. Overall, I was disappointed. Prices are on the high side, yes portions are bigger than average, but service wasn\u2019t up to the level is should have been.", "label": "business"}

{"text": "Sam LaGrassa's was the one place we knew ahead of time we would eat at in Boston. My son loves a good pastrami sandwich and at home we can't go out for one so we try to when we travel. We got there shortly after 12:30 and there was no line. There was a line after us and it went very quickly. We wanted to eat in and by the time we checked out there was a table for four of us. Two of us got pastrami on a French round roll, one got a pastrami diablo which was great with spicy peppers, spicy mayo and pepper jack cheese and the 4th person got a chicken vegetable wrap. Everyone loved all of their food. To each sandwich you can add condiments for no charge or extras for a charge. You can add a side and drink to make a platter or a sandwich only. The pastrami wasn't fatty and was so moist. We are going to try to make it there once more before we leave town. Would definitely recommend.", "label": "family"}

I\u2019m not a steak person but tried some of my husband\u2019s. It was so tender, it melted in your mouth. Cheeseburger was very juicy and cooked just the way I wanted.

The Bruschetta plate was almost like pizza bc they bring you 4 large pieces with melted cheese on top. The house veal dish had a mushroom sauce that was sweet - tasted like they added maple syrup to it. My wife\u2019s lemon chicken dish was probably the best one but again was a huge plate. My son had the house special which had chicken, veal and sausage. The veal was dry and chewy - not sure it was really veal. The sausage was almost inedible.

Our fellow diners' conversation seemed to dominate our evening, not their fault, just very bad seating plan. There were empty tables for couples elsewhere in the restaurant so I am dumbfounded as to why they seated so many people so close to each other. When I informed our waiter I had a dietary requirement he asked if this was an allergy or just an avoidance!!! When we left we asked the 'front of house' if he could arrange a taxi.

When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the host who brought us to our table. He was also happy to make us change in quarters for the old style parking meters on Boylston Street outside (quarters only). The decor was pleasant and the atmosphere upbeat. They have a nice bar set up near the entrance. Our booth was roomy and clean. Our drink order was also taken promptly and arrived quickly. Refills were offered periodically. By the server without much prodding. The signature dish on the show was the Mac N Cheese Burger, so we ordered that. The meal came with some potato chips and our server recommended we get an order of fries in addition. The burger came with a large dollop of Mac N Cheese, and bacon strips. The Burger was cooked to our specifications, but it unfortunately did not have very much flavour. The large amount of Mac N Cheese, while tasty, did not salvage the overall underwhelming taste of the burger itself. We were disapppointed. The potato chips that come with the meal were alright, and the fries were ok as well. The server's advice to get both was in fact overkill, and we left some of both leftover. We are not sure what Triple D saw in this dish, as it was ok but really nothing to recommend or write home about. Good service, nice atmosphere, yes.....but that wasn't the draw in the first place. Prices were in line with what we expected for a gourmet burger joint, moderate to inexpensive. Overall, while the people were nice and the atmosphere inviting, the food really is ok at best. On our next trip to Boston, we will certainly try a different place and will not likely in all honesty return here.

{"text": "We were staying at the Park Plaza for a business meeting and saw that this place was highly rated and within walking distance, so we had to check it out. We were not disappointed. The food was delicious starting with the fresh raw oysters that we shared (had three different types), all good. We also had two different types of soup, both very good. The fish of the day was nicely prepared to order, though the portions were big. Did not save enough room for desert. The selection of local beers was also very good, as was the selection of wines. The place is large and a bit noisy, but we had a great time. I would definitely recommend it.", "label": "business"}
{"text": "Just off Hanover St. this little gem has a very authentic Italian feel. We made reservations and were glad we did. There aren\u2019t many tables and around 7pm they were pretty busy. We had ravioli as an appetizer and they were fantastic. The gnocchi and tagliatelle with meatballs both appeared to have homemade pasta (based on look and taste) but the Pasta Spinaci and Chicken Parmesan appeared to be boxed penne, despite being told the pasta was made in house. Still not a deal breaker though, the food was wonderful. The only thing better was the service. But plan for a longer dining experience, they aren\u2019t in a rush to push you out the door, which we appreciated. This is a family owned and operated restaurant which we love to patronize and the matriarch Barbara even made an appearance.", "label": "family"}

I did not feel like steak and the salmon I had was just perfect - moist, flavorful and melt-in-your mouth - good to know if there's a less than enthusiastic carnivore in your party. The sides are wonderful also, especially the creamed spinach - fresh, not overcooked and the flavor was amazing. Great service - it was like watching a ballet or performance of some sort. Very noisy, not what I would call a romantic type place but definitely fun for people watching!", "label": "business"}
{"text": "This was my first trip to Boston. I was attending a conference for three days. David's was a highly recommended choice by FindMe GlutenFree app, and I now know why. David's has the most extensive gluten free menu I have ever personally experienced in a restaurant. That said, the rest of their menu was extensive and varied. My dinner that first night was outstanding. Since being diagnosed with celiac disease, I had never before been able to eat gnocchi while dining--which is exactly what I ordered from the gluten-free menu. These were little pillows of heavenliness--as was my starting appetizer. (You can find my pictures from Davio's at Steph.simply on Instagram and Facebook.) Additionally, the bar staff, where I sat, was attentive to my every need, friendly beyond my expectations, and very helpful at recommending wine and food. Anna, Erin, Kim, Danielle, and Juan the bar back were all absolutely the best staff with whom I have ever interacted. In fact, I was so impressed after the first night, that I returned every single night I was in town. Furthermore, I loved it so very much, I am driving 13+ hours two weeks after this visit to bring my husband and daughter to see the city, and more importantly, eat at Davio's. I swear, I dream of this food and wish there was one closer! Outstanding dining experience, beautifully plated food that tastes even better than it looks, a warm, inviting atmosphere, and THE BEST BAR STAFF!!! If you've never visited--you have to make this the trip to Davio's. You will not be disappointed--especially if you sit at the bar!", "label": "business"}
{"text": "We were a walk in on a very busy evening but they told us to wait and after 15-20 min they could seat us. It appeared there were only 2 waiters and 1 clearer for the whole of the restaurant so they were very busy. The service was friendly and prompt so they did a fantastic job keeping up with that many customers. The food was average though and we were totally thrown by two whole sausages being served ontop of our pasta- I know we ordered the sausage pasta but expected it to be all chopped up and tossed into the food and being honest none of the flavours in this dish really worked together so we mostly ate all the fresh brocoli. Our other dish was creamy and was ok, nothing special unfortunately. There were quite a lot of people finishing their food with half empty plates and whilst we were waiting to be seated saw a few others picking at it and struggling with the pasta stuck together. Maybe they had an odd night of being understaffed but for us this was just an average visit and served a purpose.", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "My love and I recently had the pleasure of dining at Davios during our last night in Boston. The location and ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful. It was appropriately priced for a fine dining experience. He had the lobster risotto which was good and nicely cooked. I had the braised beef short ribs that were amazing and ordered a size of Mac and cheese with truffle oil. This is was pulled the meal down. I like to think I'm a little bit of an M&C connoisseur. This had a thin, bland, grey cheese sauce and the noodles were gummy. Kraft would have been a better replacement. Not sure if its always like this or if mine was just poorly executed but overall it was an enjoyable dinner and we would go back again", "label": "romantic"}

There are many more great Boston restaurants to try. It still remains one of my top picks", "label": "business"}
{"text": "Had a great dinner here this week. Service is great, food excellent. I had the 100 day aged rib eye, with a side of tater tots in truffle oil, and brussel sprouts. Tater tots were great -- super light on the inside, nice thin crunch, and a definite truffle favor. Brussel sprouts with raclette and bacon was a great idea, nice combination, if a bit heavy. The steak was really good, I was a bit skeptical because just for the record, the 100 day rib eye is WET-aged not dry-aged (some previous reviewers incorrectly stated that it was dry aged). It is a bit confusing, since the menu doesn't specify, so I asked the server. It's definitely wet-aged. I love dry aged steak, and do my own dry aging at home, so I was skeptical, but had to give it a try. I really did enjoy it -- very very tender with nice beefy flavor, although none of the traditional funky flavor from the dry aging process. I really want to understand how they do it, and why their wet aged process produces such a nice steak. Maybe it has more to do with the quality of the meat, than the wet-aging, and the 100-days is just a red herring? One downside -- they should really have a better selection of wines by the glass. Not a huge deal, since most people order bottles, but for those that do prefer wine by the glass, they should really have some better choices.", "label": "business"}
{"text": "While travelling for business, a group I was with chose this restaurant for an evening meal. I live in Spain, and while I was in Boston on business, my wife was also travelling on business in Brisbane, leaving our two sons (8 and 11) in the care of my wife's brother. I obviously wanted to check in with my wife and with my kids so when I saw the wifi come up, I asked one of the waiters for the password. He refused to give it to me. I asked to speak to someone to complain to. The evening manager showed up, and while he was understanding, he didn't give me the password either. This ruined a perfectly good night out for me.

We started with a nice Onion Soup Gratinee -- a very large portion of soup that would have been a whole meal if we hadn't shared it. My wife had the beef tenderloin -- which was a very nice cut with potatoes and vegetables. I had the duck risotto -- a half-duck on a mixture of cherries and mushrooms with just a touch of rice. There was so much, I had to take it home -- and got two more meals out of it. We finished up with profiteroles -- a nice chocolatey puff pastry with wonderful vanilla.

Sorry, it's been a long day.\" We were both very upset and confused at the hostility.

It was not large but had a very warm feel. Our meal started with the delicious caramelized onion focaccia on the table. I had the amazing fig appetizer -- roasted figs wrapped in prosciutto, stuffed with melting gorgonzola cheese and drizzled with aged balsamic vinegar. I also tried the zucchini flower appetizer -- lightly breaded and fried, stuffed with cheese, served over polenta, pancetta and roasted tomato. It was very good, but the figs were the clear winner. For my entree I had the tagliatelle a la bolognese. This was no run of the mill bolognese; It was a rustic meat ragout mixed with a porcini cream and pecorino cheese. For dessert, I had the recommended white chocolate bread pudding served with vanilla bean ice cream and creme anglaise. I also tasted our friend's strawberry-rhubarb cobbler, which was good, but my dessert was the star. Service was attentive, and the food was wonderful. I would return in a moment!", "label": "romantic"}

{"text": "Maybe I'm splitting hairs, but, shouldn't a $50+ steak blow you away. My bone-in rib eye didn't. Sure, it was good, but, just not great. I was part of a business dinner at the Grille on a weeknight. They took us right on time, and seated us right in the gaze of Red Auerbach who looked very happy there. It's easy to pour scotch on the rocks, but, the pour was large. Later in the evening, the bar came up with an ice sphere with orange peel for my friend's Burbon - a coup that became tastier as it melted. I was the only one with a starter - a salad special with dried pork, fresh heirloom tomatoes and a fresh cheese on the top - not diet, but awfully tasty. It was the steaks, of all things, that disappointed. We all had bone-in Rib Eyes - two medium rare and mine rare. Yes, they were good, but, nothing special. I do better on my grill at home. So, do I recommend the Grille? Yes, for a special place with great service.", "label": "business"}

We were intrigued by the shakes we saw people eating and the menu online. The open kitchen was a nice addition. I ordered hottest boneless buffalo wings with blue cheese and the chocolate peanut butter shake and my mom got a burger with the chocolate shake. The wings were great with the right amount of heat, and my mother said her burger was on the best she\u2019s had. I even dipped a few wings into my shake- pretty good. The peanut butter shake was large with every flavor coming through and melding together. I could have done without the decorations but it was trendy so I\u2019ll forgive it. My mother thought hers was just as decadent. It was a great meal and we want to come back as soon as we can to eat it again.", "label": "family"}

{"text": "We went to Boston for our 20th anniversary. We looked at a lot of places (Boston has so many restaurants to choose from!) and decided on Davio's based on the menu. I really wanted to try the black ink pasta dish. We made reservations through Open Table the afternoon of our visit. We were greeted warmly by the front staff. We forgot to ask (beforehand) for a quiet table; the main room where we were seated was noisy. I did not have a good view of the open kitchen. Our table was also next to one of the columns (our waiter could not get to my husband's right side & my left side) and too close to another table. Maybe our table was a last minute addition due to the last minute reservation. After we were seated, we were served puffed pastry, butter & water. Our waiter, Jos\u00e9, was wonderful - attentive without being intrusive, extra patient (reservation for 7pm & left after 1030pm) and very accommodating. He explained the different pastas, how only Davio's have the Brandt Beef, that the restaurant is a la cart. He was able to change the entr\u00e9e (Squid Ink Conchiglie Calamari) to an appetizer for two (we also ordered the grilled octopus) and split the 18 oz. Ribeye for us. We had many sides - horseradish mashed potatoes (husband loved this one also & already made his version of this dish at home), broccoli rabe, asparagus. For dessert we had Boston Cream pie and bread pudding. My husband was not sure of the squid ink pasta dish but declared it so delicious & that it was his favorite food that night. The staff was very attentive. I witnessed one of the waiters help a lady patron put her coat on. When my husband went to use the bathroom, the ever-roving manager stopped by our table, took my husband's napkin and put a fresh one on the table. When he saw me coming, he was also quick to guide me to the bathroom even before I could ask where the bathroom was. Jos\u00e9 would occasionally scrape the crumbs off our table (although he could not access my husband's right & my left side) and change our silverware after every course.

They said the sauce was different than a usual pizza and very good. Another person in our group ordered eggplant and said it had a little too much cheese, but gave it to someone in our group and they loved it. The bread and dipping sauce they give you isn\u2019t that great - bitter. All pastas are homemade! The portions are HUGE. You will most likely have to wait in a long line, even on a weeknight, but it goes fast (around 20 minutes for us). There is NO street parking except for residents.
