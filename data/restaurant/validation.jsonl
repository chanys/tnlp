{"text": "Wow! Excellent food and great for kids!! Food was amazing and service spot on and friendly (especially with the kiddos). Lobster ravioli appetizer with lots of sauce for dipping with the amazing fresh bread served upon seating. Split a special vegetarian pasta entree which was just as good and tasty. Large portions. Server suggested two adults split an appetizer and split an entree and that was more than enough to fill us up after a busy day touring Boston. Kids (9 and 6 years old) had children\u2019s pizza and penne pasta plain with a little butter and they devoured it. And these are two typically very picky eaters. Seems like we can never find a restaurant that both kids enjoy but they both loved it!!! A win all the way around\u2026too bad we live 1500 miles away!", "label": "family"}
{"text": "My husband and I had dinner at Tresca a couple of days ago. We shared the meatball appetizer and then we both had a nightly veal chop preparation. Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were extremely generous. The veal came with a side of pasta that had a Bolognese sauce. This was also fantastic. The service was warm and friendly, as well as efficient. We parked in the garage where the restaurant provides validation, so only paid $3 to park - a bonus. We will definitely be back.", "label": "romantic"}

Am overzealous waiter will spend 15 mins explain entire menu and insist you have the specials. 2. You order an appetiser and explicitly explain you want 15 mins between courses 3. You take two mouthfuls of appetiser and they try to whip your plate away as main has arrived. 4. You explain point 2. again in horror, did the misunderstand? 5. They leave mains in table 6. You sit overwhelmed with food 7. Do I leave starter as main going cold, do I eat starter and just forget about main? 8. Oh no, choice made for me waiter has whipped away starter, not asked not listening just takes it. 9. Leave pretty sharply feeling hugely disappointed. 10. And repeat in next visits. 11.

{"text": "My colleagues and I have visited this restaurant numerous times - unfortunately their reputation exceeds the experience. The food is good, but for a famed steak house... the steak simply isn't as good as some of the other local spots. Not that I've had a bad meal, but I've never been blown away. I feel the service is better than the food. We always have a fantastic server, which that alone would get us to come back. Unfortunately, our latest visit left a sour taste in my mouth. I chose to valet my car, I usually don't. After the meal, we departed and I went to retrieve my vehicle. The girl working the valet was extremely rude. They pulled my car around, and I attempted to pay the $21 valet charge. I went to hand my card over & she looks at me and says \"we don't take cards..\" i was surprised, I don't know many people that carry cash these days. I said \"I'm sorry.. I don't have any cash on me\". She shrugged her shoulders at me.. I tried to explain that I never carry cash. \"Can I pay inside?\" She said \"No.\" I was really baffled and said \"I don't know what to do... I wish you would have told me before when I left my car with you. It might be something you want to disclose right away\". Again, very rude - her response \"yeah well it's just today.. the machines broken\" I asked her what I should do, obviously I need my car to get home. She shrugged again and said \"I don't know..\" then turned to talk to her colleague like I should just leave her alone. Really? Hello.. I need my car!! She was acting like I wasn't even standing there anymore. I can't even put into words how shocked I was, it felt like I was in the twilight zone. I had to interrupt her and say.. \"is there an ATM or something I can go to?!\" She pointed down the street and said inside Trader Joe's. Then turned back around and continued her conversation. I had to WALK down the street in my heels, at night to find an ATM. There wasn't even an ATM where she said there was, I had to use a bank other than my own, further down the street and pay a fee to withdraw money. I walked back and paid. They weren't going to give me a receipt, I had to ask - very questionable. They didn't have change, she went into her clutch and got change, again very questionable. They never offered an apology or seemed even slightly empathetic. I remained respectful and didn't cause a scene... it's just not in my nature. Instead, I will never return to the capital grille. That evening we had a private room for a meeting for the 3rd time at this restaurant. Chosen per my suggestion, which I will not do again. After speaking to my coworker, he told me I should have gone inside and caused a scene. This, again, just isn't in my nature. But I will absolutely write a review and try my hardest to deter people from dining here. I will also make sure all my clients know not to come here when in the city. I would hate for them to have that experience after my suggestion. I know it wasn't the restaurant itself or the wait staff, but they still represent the Capital Grille and what I experienced was completely unacceptable.", "label": "business"}
{"text": "My first experience here was terrific. Romantic atmosphere and great waitstaff. Sensitive and accommodating to food allergies. Thankfully my second experience here was not my first or I would genuinely never return. I notified the restaurant ahead of time that it was a special occassion and we possibly got the worst table near the kitchen and entrance. The waiter was extremely pushy about ordering more food than we wanted (example we wanted 1 appetizer and he tried to convince to order 2 for more than 5 minutes). We ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, several glasses of wine, a dessert and a dessert drink (whiskey and dessert wine). The waiter was asking us for our valet ticket before he even brought the dessert over to our table! He then asked for it again when dessert was finished but our dessert drinks were about half drank he than asked AGAIN 10 mins later. It was absolutely ridiculous.", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "My wife, mother-in-law, and I were in Boston on vacation, and I carefully researched Italian restaurants (the \"North End\" is Boston's \"Little Italy\"), and decided on La Summa. You should call ahead for reservations (ask for the corner table at the back by the non-heating \"fireplace\"), and I recommend you do as the Italian restaurants generally get very busy. This place was on Fleet street, just off the main road where similar restaurants are. It is a rather small (cozy) place; I counted 14 tables and on a Sunday night about 6pm most of them were full. There was a family in there celebrating what looked like a birthday, so I got the impression local folks come here too. They had our reservation, and gave us the nice table in the corner, and service was prompt. One small but noteworhty issue is my mother-in-law wanted mussels and we were told (by someone that I presume was the owner) they were out of mussels and steak since being hit so hard on the busy Saturday night before. But he offered to custom make a Shrimp Scampi to suite her her finnicky appetite and she thought it was great. We also had the Caprese salad and the Arugula salas with lemon vinagerette. We were going to order more than one, but he told us one of each was more than enough for the thee of us, and he was right. With seafood not being my favorite and having had it the night before, I opted for the chicken parmesan, and it was very good. The portions were reasonble, and we skipped dessert, though decided to get coffee. We were told they only had American coffee and espresso, so we had the latter. I was suprised they did not offer cappucino in an itialian restuarant. For a moderately priced restaurant I felt the prices were a bit much but that was mostly in the espresso. So being out of some things and not having others at all took me from a \"5\" rating to a \"3\" but the service and accomodation for being out of some things took me back to a \"4.\" Now, a word on Italian food. I've been to all regions of Italy several times, and they pride themselves in the quality of the oils, sauces, and spices. However, for those who are not familiar, it is important to know that real italian tomato sauce is not particularly spicy--the focus is really on the tomatoes. So don't expect a lot of garlic, onion and oregano. That said, La Summa is indeed authentic Italian and overall, very good. I would reccomend it.", "label": "family"}

{"text": "I dined here for a business meal on my first night in Boston. Great atmosphere, good service, superb food. The tuna tartare was a good start and the Dover sole was worth the price. Salmon was perfectly cooked and paired with nice veggies. Tip: the restaurant has a limo service, so if you ask nicely, they can take you to your hotel. Tip: if you take the Amtrak train to Boston, get out at the Back Bay station. The restaurant is literally 100 ft down the street across from the station.", "label": "business"}
{"text": "I must say I was very impressed from the very beginning. It's a very cozy atmosphere as you walk in. We were seated by the decorative fireplace in the corner. It was a fantastic spot. The service started immediately. They brought out fresh rustic bread with butter. It was so good. We were initially disappointed that they didn't have mussels, but the server (who I believe was the owner) immediately offered to make my mother a shrimp scampi which was not on the menu. Mom loves shrimp scampi so she was very satisfied. We decided to get 2 salads as the appetizer. We got the caprese and the arugula salad. We almost ordered one for each person but were told that the salads are large and could be shared. That was a great suggestion. We loved both salads. I've never seen my 91 year old mother eat so much salad. The arugula salad had chopped fennel with this wonderful olive oil lemon vinaigrette. I've never had anything like it. I'd order it again and again if I lived in Boston. The caprese salad was also unique in that it had a pepper and olive garnish surrounding the tomatoes and mozzarella. My husband and I took some of the leftover bread to soak up some of the oil. It was that good. Our meals came out not too long after that. I had the Frutti di Mare in a white sauce. Now, as you remember, they had no mussels. They sold out of them the night before. With that said, they gave me more clams and calamari. It was excellent! It had a nice light sauce that complimented the fish without it be overbearing. The calamari was cooked perfectly. In other words, it wasn't rubbery and overcooked like most restaurants do these days. These people know how to cook their seafood. The clams were plentiful and sweet. The pasta was also cooked perfectly. I loved every bite of it. Mom loved her shrimp scampi. She raved about the sauce. I've read other reviews that say their sauces are bland, and I have to disagree. This is authentic Italian, not the Americanized Italian. They cook basic sauces with fresh herbs. The sauce is supposed to compliment the dish, not overpower it. Don't expect anything to be spicy unless you order fra diavolo. Just saying. We ended our meal with espresso. It was a very good cup of espresso with great flavor. I was just a little surprised that they don't serve cappuccino. Also, the price of the espresso was a little high (we thought). I suggest getting your coffee at one of the many pasty shops nearby. Other than that, I'd do it all over again. It truly is a hidden gem on Fleet Street. Most people don't venture far from Hanover Street, and that's a big mistake. Our tour guide told us that she's never had a bad Italian meal in the North End, and I've heard that from numerous people. She also told us that the best ones can be found away from the street that everyone flocks to. Just remember that when researching and planning your visit. Oh, and make sure you make a reservation because there won't be any seats left in any of these restaurants on a busy Friday or Saturday night.", "label": "family"}

I cancelled my food order before it came and they accommodated this cancellation, thank you for that truly. When the food arrived for my family things were not hot, the pastas and sauces were of poor quality. We noticed several other people handing their dishes back. Overall if cooking pasta is your thing , it shouldn\u2019t arrive all mushy and inedible and the sauce had the taste like it came out of a can, it tasted like metallic , not good any longer.

A two hour wait for a table when you have a reservation is unacceptable anywhere in the world. If it was my booking, I would have walked away. It was not, so I stayed, but it totally ruined the evening. The food was ok and I was with an awesome group of people. But this is a very expensive restaurant and you expect more. I will never return and I would encourage you to not bother going here. Unless it is where you always go and then they are probably charming.

This gem is tucked off Hanover Street and is a quiet restaurant where conversations are the priority, not music or sports on tv. Our waitress was superb in welcoming us and giving a brief history of the establishment. We had stuffed mushrooms and raviolis for apps-I noted the excellent red sauce with a very nice balance, nothing overwhelming and complimenting the food. Two large salads followed, both fresh and delicious. What really wowed me was the entrees. I had the veal Vitello Speciale. Fantastic, with a slight hint of chili pepper and complemented by home made pasta which was delicious. My wife had the manicotti and loved it. My adult son wiped out his fettuccine Alfredo. Had a bottle of $30 Chianti and all the entrees in high teens, low $20 range. I thought it was 1999 before the North End got crazy. A 5 star experience all around.

{"text": "My husband and I went here for our \"first night of freedom\" after just having a baby. I saw the great reviews/ratings on here and expected a lot from Deuxave. I booked the reservation on OpenTable and asked for a quiet table and indicated what we were celebrated. When we arrived, our table wasn't quite ready so we went to the bar and attempted to order a glass of wine, but the bartender completely ignored us and was even cutting up limes - the bar wasn't even that busy! When the hostess grabbed us to take us to our table, both she and the server congratulated us, which I thought was nice. The restaurant is beautiful and the table they gave us was about as quiet as you could get in there, but we still had a hard time carrying on a conversation. We got a really nice bottle of Barolo, which they decanted for us and I thought that was a nice touch. I'm no stranger to fine dining and it's rare to find a restaurant that offers to decant your wine. We split the duck confit and lobster/gnocchi appetizers, which were both tasty, but small in portions and not very hot. Then we split the special halibut w/risotto entree as well as the \"which came first\" - again, but were tasty but only luke warm at best. The halibut was cooked perfectly but the risotto it came over left a lot to be desired. The portions were also still a bit small. Upon receiving the dessert menu, I mentioned to our server that our food wasn't hot and since we didn't order dessert, they provided the both of us with a glass of dessert wine, which was a nice gesture, but a bit too little too late. Considering we spent $350 to be ignored at the bar, eat cold food, and leave still feeling hungry ... it is safe to say that we will not be returning to Deuxave. I hope it was just an off night or experience because I expect a lot more from my fellow TripAdvisor reviewers!", "label": "romantic"}

The bolognese, chicken parm and frutti di Mari dishes were very good and portions were generous. However the spaghetti and meatballs was just ok - not a ton of flavor in the marinara sauce.

I really should have stopped eating way before I did. It was so good. The slaw was fantastic and when combined with the mustard, it just brought the whole sandwich together. Hubby had the Pastrami Corned Beef combo and ate the whole thing! He was amazed at how tender the meat was. Our daughter had a Ham and Cheese and ate like two bites. It was way too much food for her. But she said it was really good. For sure she should have shared with one of us, but alas, vacation and over-indulgence go hand in hand. Pricing was similar to that of other delis. But nicely, they do have their prices listed on their online menu. Sandwiches are like $13 each. We go to Katz's Deli in Houston and the pricing is about right. Now, the place is SMALL. We were lucky enough to get there early enough to get a table. You order at the counter and then go find a seat if you can. I didn't count, but there couldn't have been more than 10-12 tables in there. When we were leaving, there seemed to be people standing everywhere! But, don't let that keep you from going.

Our entrees were the lobster agnolotti pasta and the clams and bay scallops pasta. Both were unbelievably good.

{"text": "True French gem hidden in the busy Newbury Street in Boston. The minute you enter, you think you are in France and when you start eating, the dream is complete! You are definitely transported there! It is so typically French that you even end up talking to your neighbors as we often do in my native country of France. I love the food and the \"Prix Fixe\" menu offered is very reasonable and I highly recommend it. The wine list is also excellent with a wide choice. My only concern is how close the tables are...", "label": "romantic"}

The restaurant closes at 9:00 pm, fortunately we got there at 8:52. We were greeted and seated right away with delicious Italian bread and there oil dipping. I got Chicken Parmigiana and my wife got a Caprese Salad. We split a delicious bottle of Red Wine. The restaurant was clean and warm with a roaring fire. The staff was attentive and very friendly . Alejandro was our waiter and he was fabulous. We told him we only had 45 minutes because we had tickets for a show up the street. Alejandro said he would make sure we would make it. A few minutes later our dinner was at our table. Everything was perfect. Thank you La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s, we will definitely be vack", "label": "family"}

{"text": "This is a good looking restaurant and has a great atmosphere. The food gets a 10/10 however the service is very imporsanable. The staff seem to want to just upsell you everything. They seem to turn their nose up at you if you're a non-alcoholic drinker (can't sell you their over priced wines). The arrogance is shown in the fact that the waiters have their own business cards... really?! There are many steak restaurants in Boston - choose this one if you want great food with mediocre service.", "label": "romantic"}

{"text": "My husband and I visited for our 1 year anniversary. We each had a cocktail and thoroughly enjoyed each one. (The dirty Shirley and Pineapple Basil). The popovers provided to our table were AMAZINGLY delicious. As an appetizer we got the burrata and prosciutto dish. It was delicious. The only thing that could be improved would be for the bread to have slightly less char (it was quite black for over 30% of the bread). For our main courses I had the penne with smoked chicken, walnuts and sundried-tomatoes. It was DELICIOUS. I wouldn't change anything about it. My husband had a shrimp, lemon, and pasta dish. He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert I had the chocolate cake with a molten center with vanilla gelato. It was DIVINE. My husband had the tiramisu. He said it was amazing. The service was wonderful throughout the meal. The service team worked effortlessly together. We appreciated the special touch of a special anniversary message being written on our desserts. What a great way to end a special meal for us!", "label": "romantic"}

Service is beyond outstanding; like ninjas, didn\u2019t know they were there but glasses NEVER empty and dishes disappeared the instant the food was gone. The food is out of this world. Piping hot and soooo good. Mostly Northern Italian. The pasta was perfect and the sauces unique and packed with flavor. Literately EVERYTHING, cocktails, bread, beer, app, salad, entree, desert, coffee, EVERYTHING was perfect. Absolutely will tell everyone from Cape Cod about Sorellina and will definitely be back!", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "The #1 restaurant in Boston?! That rating and some of the glowing reviews led us to drive through Boston during a Friday rush hour to dine there. It\u2019s small and homey and obviously a popular place. Ursula, the owner, may be the main reason for that. She\u2019s very welcoming and friendly, whether you are a regular or a new customer. But the food just doesn\u2019t make the grade. My husband ordered soup to start which he might not have done had he known we were all getting side salads. Those lettuce and tomato salads were mediocre at best. My husband and I both ordered pappardelle Bolognese. They were served barely lukewarm. My husband asked for his to be reheated. They whisked it away without bothering to ask if mine needed reheating as well. The pappardelle was heavy, probably not homemade. The rest of our party ate without complaint but obviously weren\u2019t loving their food.", "label": "family"}
{"text": "Visiting Boston and reviews were good...but we found the cuisine to be just average. My wife had a 3 course prix fixe with an upcharge for a filet, which was overcooked. Sliced tomato app with mozz and basil was just ok. Dessert ..still not sure what it was but kind of a layered pastry was also just ok. Our conclusion ..nice small place, very friendly staff, but very average food", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "We saved this restaurant for our last night in Boston, and we were not disappointed! It is a beautifully decorated restaurant and really romantic. Our waiter was from Italy so we felt like it was so authentic. We had the homemade pasta for our main dish. Usually, when you go to these high end restaurants, you just get a little bit of pasta, but this place gave you enough pasta for two! I loved it. The pasta was cooked al dente (a bit hard) just the way I like it. Many places make the pasta mushy, but not here. The menu changes from day to day depending on what the chef can get. It was simply amazing. A bit pricey but well worth the extra money!", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "Election night-midterms. Asked bartender to change TV station from CNN to local Boston station. She refused because \u201cthis station was a request from guest\u201d, \u201cyou can move down to seats by other tv and other bartender will put the station on for you\u201d. There was no one else at the bar and only one party at a table. The male bartender said \u201cshe\u2019s a diehard Democrat and wants to watch CNN tonight-it\u2019s what she does\u201d. We were shocked and asked her which guest made the request? Clearly her political interests were more important than servicing us. After arguing that there was no one else in the bar area watching TV, she finally changed the station. She was so unpleasant-male bartender tried very hard to accommodate us but we apparently weren\u2019t in his section. $35.00 for two drinks with free harassment from rude bartender. NEVER AGAIN.", "label": "romantic"}
{"text": "When looking at the reviews all of the current ones were very good or excellent so decided to give it a try. Short walk from the Marriott Long Wharf which was a plus. Food was very good and reasonably priced for Boston. My daughter loved her manicotti, clams with red sauce was very good as well. My wife had the eggplant with Pappardelle and thought it was a little bland. The arugula salad was enough for two or three. Nice bottle of white wine for $30 was also reasonable. I would certainly recommend.", "label": "family"}

{"text": "Though we weren't able to get the most romantic table in boston, this restaurant was absolutely fantastic when it comes to bringing your significant other out on a romantic dinner or anniversary. My gf and I, had an romantic and filling night. Large selection of wines ranging from 40-250 for a full bottle. The food was the hit without any doubts, calamari was 9/10, bologense 9/10 and carbanara 9.5/10. The dishes are alot in my opinion but that's good if your someone who thinks value going into any meal out. Staff phenomenal, Maria our waitress was upbeat, ready to provide recommendations and had food come out to the speed desired. Loved having appetizers out right away and slow it down toward the entree. Maria and kitchen staff was able to even given a complimentary dessert to celebrate our 1 year anniversary, not all restaurants do this and can be a hit or miss when trying something new.

There were many breakfast choices on the menu, I had a scramble and my son had a combo meal of sorts that pretty much had everything. Food came quickly and was hot and fresh. Coffee was refilled and despite the crowd we were attended to nicely. One note- the space isn\u2019t large and it seems popular so you may find yourself sitting within inches of strangers but from what I\u2019ve now read just getting a table is a challenge.

The place was packed, but the hostess and wait staff went above and beyond finding us a spot to eat breakfast with little wait time. As you wait for your order to be served you are provided fresh, warm banana nut bread. It\u2019s delicious! The breakfast itself was outstanding.! The service was fantastic!

{"text": "We kept seeing Deauxave at the top of the Trip Advisor listings for Boston, after it overcame L'Espalier and Mistral and others. So we had to try it. First, it is a GOOD restaurant. Very nice atmosphere. Good service. Good valet parking. Nice location. Romantic but not in a syrupy way. Not too loud. However, it is not a GREAT restaurant, and it certainly isn't the best in Boston. Now, to the food. The salad was a pleasant surprise, formed inside a crispy potato \"bowl\", and very large portion. The lobster gnocchi was tasty, but the salsa was a bit overwhelming. The duck was very tender and tasty, with a salted crust that was excellent. BUT -- the veal dish was over salted. And the mushroom side order was dry and again over salted. The waitress did not come to ask about our main courses which at a restaurant of this quality was disappointing. Overall, we give it three stars, not five. And we want to let our fellow Bostonians know that it is not the top restaurant, and that you should try a whole host of other restaurants before coming here.", "label": "romantic"}

{"text": "Mistral is the restaurant we go to when we want to celebrate an occasion, though it is also good for business meals or a place to get together with friends. It is a restaurant that people of all ages go to, though the crowd tends to get younger as the evening gets later. All the food is excellently prepared. I usually avoid bread, but their fresh bread destroys my will power. I love the tuna or salmon tatare and the fois gras/duck confit appetizers. All the entrees and desserts are exceptional; I have tried them all. I do miss the home made mint chocolate chip ice cream and wish it would return to the menu. The service at Mistral is as exceptional. From the moment the valet takes your car you feel warmly welcomed. The wait staff is helpful and friendly and make wonderful suggestions about the food and the wine. If there is anything you need the staff is more than willing to help you with it. One time we arrived with a flat tire and the valet took our AAA card. When we came out after the meal our tire had been repaired.

My husband and I have the tendency to walk into fancy restaurants and eat despite being dressed down for the occasion. We came in simple clothes in the middle of the day to celebrate his birthday. Diego was incredible! He treated us with the same welcoming and pleasant professional attitude as any other billionaire that goes to that place. He made us feel completely at ease and the entire experience was a blessing! He is indeed a role model of costumer service. I hope he gets enough praises for his amazing service. Everything was great! The ambient is nice and romantic. The only improvement I can suggest is to tell the hostess to welcome guests with a smile!
